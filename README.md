# Neural-Network-GPA-Classification-Algorithm
This is a neural network algorithm for prediction of first semester grade point average (GPA) of newly admitted freshmen
The goal of this project is to predict the first semester grade point average (GPA) category (< 2.0 | > 2.0) of newly admitted freshmen using the following predictors: high school gpa, high school math score, gender, minority, hs_flang, act_sat score, app_days, aframer and stdnt_need_amt using  Neural network classification algorithm.
The performance of the neural network algorithm was evaluated and following results were achieved: 
training accuracy:  86.4 %
test accuracy:  85.0 %
precision:  85.0 %
recall: 85.0 %
f1-score: 85.0 %
